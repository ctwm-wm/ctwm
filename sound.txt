I would also like to give proper credit for the window manager patches.
Olvwm patches where originally implemented by Andrew "Ender" Scherpbier (Andrew@SDSU.Edu)
and were later modified to support tvtwm and twm by J.E. Sacco (jsacco @ssl.com).
I slightly modified the tvtwm patches to support ctwm.

Oops, I forgot to tell you what has been changed in ctwm.  Two new functions have
been added:

	f.rereadsounds	- rereads the .ctwm-sounds file
	f.togglesound	- turns on/off the sound

and I added:

	SoundHost "hostname"	- where hostname is the host to play sounds on.

The .ctwm-sounds file has the following format <X Event> <sound>:

KeyPress:	Cork.au
MapNotify:	turbbeep.au
ResizeRequest:	failure.au
Startup:	2lust.au
Shutdown:	1sadeness.au
