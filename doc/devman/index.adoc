= CTWM Developer's Manual

Eventually, this will be a full compendium of all the information that a
Real CTWM Dev will already have in their head and never need to be
reminded of.


== Pages

* <<functions.adoc#,f.functions>> talks about how the various
`f.whatever` functions are dispatched and how you'd go about writing one.

* <<principles.adoc#,Principles Of Operation>> is a pre-existing dev
document that covers a number of areas.  Probably over time it'll get
piecewise integrated into bigger individual sections.
